            Hi, Iâ€™m Timonâ€”a passionate technology enthusiast with a curious mind and a strong drive to create. I thrive on new challenges, 
            adapt quickly to different environments, and connect easily with people. Currently, Iâ€™m studying Computer Science at 
            the Frankfurt University of Applied Sciences, where I focus on algorithms, programming, and problem-solving.
          </p>
          <p>
            My journey into tech began when I was 12, driven by my fascination with Minecraft. I wanted to create my own Minecraft 
            custom client in Java, even though I had no prior programming experience. That project was my first encounter with codeâ€”and 
            it sparked a passion that continues to grow. Alongside my love for technology, Iâ€™ve always enjoyed creative work, like 
            running my own YouTube and Twitch channels.
          </p>
          <p>
            Today, I enjoy building software and applications that combine functionality with creativity. Whether itâ€™s developing games, 
            command-line tools, or dynamic web applications, I love turning ideas into reality. Iâ€™m also highly interested in cybersecurity, 
            fascinated by how systems work behind the scenes. In my free time, youâ€™ll often find me exploring platforms like Hack The Box 
            and TryHackMe to sharpen my ethical hacking skills.
          </p>
          <p>
            My tech stack includes Python, Java, C, C++, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, HTML, and CSS. Iâ€™m always eager to expand my knowledge, 
            explore new tools, and take on challenging projects. One day, Iâ€™d love to work at companies like Apple or contribute to cybersecurity 
            initiatives at a governmental level. Until then, Iâ€™m focused on growing, learning, and building connections with like-minded people.
